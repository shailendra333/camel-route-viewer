#When 

= Build the update site in local disk =

  * [BuildingTheCode http://code.google.com/p/camel-route-viewer/wiki/BuildingTheCode]
  * Get projects for release:
    # Feature Project:https://camel-route-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/updates/project4release/com.googlecode.camelrouteviewer.feature
    # Updates Project:https://camel-route-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/updates/project4release/project4release/com.googlecode.camelrouteviewer.updates
http://camel-route-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/updates/svn/project4release/projects4release.gif

  * Update version number:Edit version number in *Plugin Project>>plugin.xml* and *Feature Project>>feature.xml*
    for example,from  *1.1.0_v20080830* to *1.2.0_v20080930*


  * Update feature in *Updates Project site.xml*,always remove the older feature,then add the newer feature just increated version number. Because I found that *Synchronize* button didn't work when version number changed.

  * Press *Build* button in *Updates Project>>site.xml>>Site Map*,then in *Updates Project* will generate two folder:features and plugins.

  * Yeah,The *Updates Project* folder is just the *${updatefolder}*.
